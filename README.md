# linefollower01
This project is a simple line-following robot built using Arduino. The bot was designed for a contest but faced challenges because the sensors used were only responsive to dark surfaces. Despite the hiccup, the code and design showcase the foundational logic and approach to creating a line-follower using basic components.
